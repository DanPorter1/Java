Calculator Class Lab

Encapsulation, Scanner & Arithmetic

Overview

In this lab you will build a fully-featured console-based Calculator
application in Java. Your program must collect two numbers from the user
via the Scanner class, store them using private fields, and expose
results through public methods. You will also implement a menu system
that allows users to repeatedly choose operations until they decide to
exit. The goal is to practise encapsulation, user input, error handling,
and good class architecture by separating concerns across multiple
classes.

Instructions

Step 1 -- Project Setup & Architecture

In your existing labs project, create a new package named lab3. Your
solution must use proper class separation:

• Program.java -- Contains main method only, wires everything together

• Calculator.java -- Handles arithmetic operations with encapsulation

• Menu.java -- Displays options and handles user menu navigation

• InputValidator.java -- Validates user input and handles errors

Each class must have a single, clear responsibility. Do not put all your code in one class.

Step 2 -- Calculator Class (private fields)

Create Calculator.java with the following private fields:

Field Name Type Purpose

numOne double First number entered by user

numTwo double Second number entered by user

result double Stores the last calculation
result

Step 3 -- InputValidator Class

Create InputValidator.java to handle all user input and error checking.
This class must:

• Use the Scanner class provided earlier to read input

• Provide a method getValidDouble() that repeatedly prompts until valid
number entered

• Provide a method getValidMenuChoice(int min, int max) for menu
validation

• Handle InputMismatchException gracefully (catch and re-prompt)

• Display clear error messages like "Invalid input. Please enter a
number."

Never let bad input crash your program. All errors must be caught and handled.

Step 4 -- Calculator: Encapsulation (Getters & Setters)

Provide public getter and setter methods for numOne and numTwo. Your
setters must include validation --- if the user somehow passes
Double.NaN or Double.isInfinite, print a warning and do not update the
field.

Step 5 -- Calculator: Operation Methods (public)

Implement the following public methods. Each must store its result in
the result field and return it:

Method Returns Description

add() double Returns numOne + numTwo

subtract() double Returns numOne - numTwo

multiply() double Returns numOne * numTwo

divide() double Returns numOne / numTwo. Must
handle divide by zero --- print
an error and return 0

getResult() double Returns the last stored result

Step 6 -- Menu Class

Create Menu.java to handle all user interaction. This class must:

• Display a welcome message when the program starts

• Provide a displayMenu() method showing numbered options:

1. Add

2. Subtract

3. Multiply

4. Divide

5. Enter new numbers

6. Exit

• Provide a displayResult() method that formats and prints calculation
results

• Provide a displayError() method for consistent error messages

The menu must loop until the user chooses to exit (option 6).

Step 7 -- Program Class (main)

Create Program.java with your main method. This class must:

• Instantiate all necessary objects (Calculator, Menu, InputValidator,
Scanner)

• Prompt user for two initial numbers using InputValidator

• Store numbers in Calculator using setters

• Use a loop to repeatedly show menu and execute chosen operation

• Handle menu option 5 (enter new numbers) by re-prompting

• Exit cleanly when user chooses option 6

• Close Scanner before program ends

This class should contain NO calculation logic, NO validation logic, and NO display formatting --- it only coordinates between the other classes.

Expected Output

=== Calculator ===

Enter first number: 10

Enter second number: 5

--- Menu ---

1. Add

2. Subtract

3. Multiply

4. Divide

5. Enter new numbers

6. Exit

Choose an option: 1

Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

--- Menu ---

...

Choose an option: 4

Result: 10.0 / 5.0 = 2.0

--- Menu ---

...

Choose an option: 6

Thank you for using Calculator. Goodbye!

Hints

Remember to import java.util.Scanner and
java.util.InputMismatchException.

Use scanner.nextDouble() to read decimal numbers in InputValidator.

Wrap scanner.nextDouble() in try-catch to handle InputMismatchException.

Use scanner.nextLine() after catching an exception to clear the buffer.

Use this.numOne inside setters to distinguish the field from the
parameter.

To check for divide by zero: if (numTwo == 0)

Use a while loop in Program.main to keep showing the menu until user
exits.

Use switch statement in Program.main to handle menu choices cleanly.

Each class should focus on ONE thing: Program coordinates, Calculator
computes, Menu displays, InputValidator validates.

Test option 5 (enter new numbers) and option 4 with zero as second
number (divide by zero).
